          <h2>PHILIPPINE EAGLE</h2>
          <p>FOUND IN LUZON, LEYTE, MINDANAO, SAMAR<br>Philippine Eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) also known as the monkey-eating eagle or great
            Philippine eagle, is a critically endangered species of eagle of the family Accipitridae which is endemic to
            forests in the Philippines. It has brown and white-colored plumage, a shaggy crest, and generally measures
            86 to 102 cm (2.82 to 3.35 ft) in length and weighs 4.04 to 8.0 kg (8.9 to 17.6 lb).
            The Philippine Eagle is like no other. With its creamy white underbellies and crown-like shaggy feathers, the critically endangered Philippine eagle surely makes a regal impression. But this one-of-a-kind eagle is now in a bad position as its population is classified as critically endangered. Now, it is among the top 10 endangered animals in the country. No more than 400 adult Philippine eagle endangered pairs remain in the wild.
            The Philippine eagle conservation status began in the 1970s and since then, the Philippine Eagle Foundation has rescued over 80 eagles already. </p>

          <h2>TAMARAW</h2>
          <p> FOUND IN MINDORO<br>Tamaraws (Bulbalus mindorensis) also known as mindoro dwarf buffalos. They are herbivores and mostly consume
            grasses, bamboo shoots and wild sugar cane. Tamaraws have been subjected to hunting for food and
            entertainment purposes in the past, which is why they are critically endangered.
            Another critically endangered animal that can soon be among the extinct animals in the Philippines is the Tamaraw, one of the endemic species in the Philippines. The tamaraw critically endangered species Philippines is only found in the province of Mindoro. It features shiny black hair, backward-facing horns, and a height no taller than a kindergartener but, has famous tempers and will readily wield their horns against intruders, a behavior called “tusking.” </p>

          <h2>TARSIER</h2>
          <p>FOUND IN BOHOL<br>Tarsiers (Tarsiidae) are small nocturnal primates that follow a carnivore diet. They mostly feed on
            various types of insects. Tarsiers tend to shy away from human contact, and are very sensitive to bright
            lights, physical contact and noises. Prior to the development of the Philippine Tarsier and Wildlife Sanctuary, many people hunted for tarsiers. The captured world’s second-smallest primates were being sold, kept as pets by private individuals in environments not conducive to their lifestyle and survival, or killed.
            Because of this, the tarsiers were declared to be specially protected faunal species of the Philippines by virtue of Proclamation No. 1030, declared by former Philippine President, Fidel V. Ramos on June 23, 1997. Hence, creating the Philippines Tarsier Sanctuary for their protection.
            Tarsiers are very sensitive to the point that they commit suicide when stressed. If these continue to happen, Philippine tarsiers will be endangered. The key to seeing the animals without disturbing them is to book the right guide. Mejia recommends the Philippine Tarsier Foundation, which runs the Philippine Tarsier and Wildlife Sanctuary in Bohol.</p>

          <h2>PHILIPPINE CROCODILE</h2>
          <p>FOUND IN NORTHERN SIERRA MADRE<br>Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis) is a kind of freshwater crocodile that is
            relatively small. Hatchlings are white on their ventral side and have a golden-brown dorsum with transverse
            dark stripes. The brown ages and gets darker. They have a comparatively large snout and thick dorsal
            armor compared to other crocodiles.
            The Philippine crocodile is usually seen as the bad livestock and man-eating animal. But in reality, what they usually eat, especially the critically endangered Philippine crocodile are snails that help farmers by controlling introduced pest species in their rice fields.
            This is among the rare animals in Philippines and in the world. Compared to other crocodiles, the critically endangered Philippine crocodile is smaller than usual which is around 5 feet in length and just over 30 pounds.</p>

            Visayan wrinkled hornbill, rufous-headed hornbill or writhed-billed hornbill is now locally extinct from the latter
            due to severe deforestation in addition to hunting and nest poaching.  It is closely related to the writhed hornbill, but can be recognized by the yellow throat and ocular skin in the male, and the blue throat and ocular skin in the female (both throat and ocular skin are deep orange or red in both sexes of the writhed hornbill). Its binomial name commemorates the Scottish ornithologist Viscount Walden.</p>

          <h2> BLEEDING HEART PIGEON</h2>
          <p>FOUND IN LUZON PUNALA<br>Bleeding heart pigeon (Gallicolumba luzonica) refers to a dark, crimson patch of feathers on
            its breast that resembles a wound that is bleeding. Males attract females during breeding season by displaying an
            enlarged breast to showcase their brilliant blood marking, or "heart." They breed in mid-May in their natural habitat, nesting in dense shrubbery or low trees. They have an incubation period of 17 days, laying 2 eggs in a clutch. They are fed by both parents, and leave the nest after 2 weeks.
            This shy bird can be difficult to find. They spend most of their time on the ground, except when they nest. They live in flocks and make cooing noises to stay in contact with each other while they forage for berries, seeds, and grubs to eat.</p>

            The underparts are paler than the rest of the body. Dark brown (nearly black in some species)
            characterizes the legs, and a dark dorsal stripe runs from the shoulders to the bushy tail's base. White lips with dark bars
            encircling them. There is a little, whitish "bib" on the upper throat. Calamian and Philippine spotted deers are among the top 10 endangered species in the Philippines. The continuing decline of the Calamian deer population is attributed to hunting, human settlement, and agricultural expansion in its habitats.

            As for the Philippine spotted deer, they are declining because of a limited range, habitat conversion (due to agriculture and logging), and hunting. They are used for game/trophies, some surplus meat is sold to specialty restaurants, and some are kept as pets (among politicians, IUCN notes). Find organizations that help protect these Philippine endangered species. Little actions go a long way.</p>

            are its natural habitat. The Sulu hornbill (Anthracoceros montani) has the smallest population of any of the Critically Endangered hornbill species and must in fact be considered the rarest and most endangered hornbill in the world.

          <p>FOUND IN PALAWAN, BASABAC AND BUSUANGA<br>Palawan Fruit bat (Acerodon leucotis) are herbivores and mostly consume leaves, fruits, flowers, sap, and twigs. Like most
            bats they are nocturnal. The Palawan fruit bats have a head-and-body length of 22–25 cm (8.7–9.8 in), with a forearm length of 13–16.5 cm (5.1–6.5 in). They lack a tail. The fur and wings are brown; the latter sometimes mottled with paler splotches.
            This species has been listed on Appendix II of CITES since 1990 and is considered vulnerable by the IUCN. The major threats are hunting and habitat loss. It is expected that much of its remaining forest habitat will be converted into plantations in the future. Since it does not form large colonies and roosting sites are inconspicuous, it has proven hard to find appropriate survey methods for precisely determining its status, but it is believed to have declined by more than 30% over the last 15 years.</p>

            distinguished by its orange-peach breast. It most likely has a very small population and has had a very quick population drop
            due to a reduction in the size of its forest habitat, which is currently only found in a few small, remnant portions spread
            across a very short area. As a result, it is listed as endangered.
            Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland secondary forests and forest edge with it being less common in primary forest. It being more common in these areas shows that it is tolerant of degraded forests.
            This species' main threat is habitat loss with wholesale clearance of forest habitats as a result of legal and illegal logging, mining and conversion into farmlands through Slash-and-burn and urbanization.

            For the green turtle, the main cause of its population decline is the overexploitation of eggs and adult females in nesting beaches, and for juveniles and males, in foraging areas; and pollution of marine habitats.
            While for the leatherback turtle, its population is most affected by incidental capture in fisheries, followed by human consumption and coastal development. The loggerhead is affected by the same causes, as well as coastal development, pollution, and climate change.
            And as for the Olive Ridley which is the most abundant sea turtle, its decline in population is affected by the impacts of egg harvest, direct take of adults, bycatch, habitat degradation (including that caused by climate change), and diseases such as fibropapilloma.</p>
