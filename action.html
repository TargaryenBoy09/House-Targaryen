    <div class = "cont">
      <p>1. Visit a national park, wildlife refuge, or protected area. These areas provide habitat for hundreds of threatened species!
        <br>2. Reduce, reuse, recycle! Recycling and reducing your waste helps our planet and all those who live on it.
        <br>3. Don’t purchase items like ivory, real tortoise shell, coral, etc. The sale of these items lead to serious population problems for endangered species.
        <br>4. Spread the word! Use your voice to speak up for the animals who can’t speak for themselves. Zoo and wildlife organizations depend on YOU to help spread their message for the animals who can’t talk. Easy examples of spreading the word include: sharing social posts, sharing links to articles, and signing petitions.
        <br>5. Donate to organizations created to help our zoo animals and wildlife (like us!) Link to donate here.
        <br>6. Grow native plants! Native plants are food for many local species. Challenge yourself to landscape with native plants, and your local animals friends will thank you!
        <br>7. Support local accredited zoos and aquariums! Zoos and aquariums help to protect species by educating others. Also, lots of zoos have breeding programs that help boost endangered population species. For a list of accredited zoos, visit this website.
        <br>8. Drive carefully! It might seem silly, but often roads are made through an animal’s habitat, forcing them to cross dangerous highways and busy roads.
        <br>9. Always keep pets on leashes when hiking or in nature to avoid putting the wildlife (or your pets) in danger.
        <br>10. Learn! Educate yourself on local endangered animals, as well as species native to your area. You never know who you are sharing your city with!</p>
